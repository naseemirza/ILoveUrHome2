    <string name="wlcomtexts">I ❤ YOUR HOME was created to help potential Homebuyers and Sellers connect.
        Bringing the two parties together, along with the help of a professional real estate agent,
        minimizes the costs, time and hassle associated with a conventional Real Estate transaction.\n\n
        For a Homebuyer, this is about helping find the perfect home whether or not that home is on the market.
        We are sure you have a house you’ve been eyeing in your favourite neighborhood- that you would love to live in.
        Unfortunately, as soon that home comes on the market, it is often too late,
        and you can find yourself in a costly bidding war. I ❤ YOUR HOME alerts the Home Owner of your interest,
        with a personalized letter and can help get you into your dream home.</string>

        For sellers, I ❤ YOUR HOME can connect you with the perfect buyer, increasing capital gains,
        without the hassle of frequent showings and open houses. Often, timing is a huge issue for sellers.
        If you want to move but aren’t sure about listing your home before you find your next property,
        this is the solution to your dilemma. In some cases, you might even be able to avoid expensive
        commissions and costly repairs to make your home more salable.\n\n
